          I'm Ignasi Ayats, a multi-disciplinary designer and curator. The two main axes of my practice intersect in a commitment to reflecting on the agency of the designer and opening the design process to collaboration between humans and non-human entities. Additionally, I am continually questioning the format and context, exploring how we can create projects that are respectful and conscious of the contexts in which they are situated, as well as seeking formats that make more sense and break away from established norms to create new spaces from which to operate.
        
          My practice lies at the intersection of art and design. As a designer and art director at Eina University of Design, I have come to understand the performativity of institutions and the spaces we can view as levers for initiating new narratives.</p>
