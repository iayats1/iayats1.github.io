        <p> "Agency and new design methodologies" </p>
        <p>

            <br>
            <br>
            Design, traditionally perceived as a process driven by the agency of the designer, often carries with it the assumption of a centralized creative force. This force orchestrates the creation of visual and spatial narratives, controlling the flow of ideas from a privileged vantage point. However, recent explorations in design methodologies challenge this notion, emphasizing the importance of distributed agency, symbiotic relationships, and the ever-evolving nature of design as an open process. Within this context, the concept of "parasitic design" emerges as a compelling framework that not only critiques the hierarchical structures inherent in traditional design practices but also celebrates the fluid, dynamic interactions that shape the design process.

            Parasitic design draws inspiration from biological symbiosis, particularly the relationship between mycelium and plant roots in mycorrhizal networks. In this network, there is no central point of control; rather, communication and resource exchange occur through a decentralized, cooperative system. This analogy serves as a powerful metaphor for design practices that reject the notion of a singular creative authority. Instead, design becomes a collaborative, multi-agent process where the role of the designer is less about dictating outcomes and more about facilitating interactions among diverse entities, both human and non-human.
            
            In such a framework, the design process is not linear or finite. It is an ongoing interaction, a conversation that evolves over time. This approach challenges the concept of the "finished" graphic or product. Instead of aiming for a definitive end product, parasitic design embraces the idea of continuous iteration and transformation. Each design output is a snapshot—a momentary expression of the interactions taking place within the system at a given time. This snapshot is not fixed; it is open to reinterpretation and reconfiguration as new agents enter the scene and new influences emerge.
            
            The idea of a "window" in design becomes particularly relevant in this context. Traditionally, the window might be seen as a controlled perspective, a way for the designer to frame the world according to a specific vision. However, in parasitic design, the window is not just a tool for framing but also a portal for external influences to enter and alter the design process. As the window opens to these interactions, the process itself becomes visible. The designer's role shifts from being the one who controls the view to being one who facilitates the view, allowing the design to be shaped by a multitude of perspectives.
            
            This shift in perspective is closely aligned with queer and xeno methodologies in design, which also challenge normative structures and embrace the multiplicity of agents involved in the creative process. By recognizing the existence of the window—that is, by acknowledging the process as open, fluid, and susceptible to external influences—designers become more aware of the relational dynamics at play. The process becomes a living entity, constantly reshaped by its interactions with other agents, much like a mycelial network that continuously adapts to its environment.
            
            In practical terms, parasitic design can be seen in projects where digital objects are created from layers of other objects, emphasizing the division and fragmentation within the design itself. These designs are not static; they are constantly interacting with the digital environment, absorbing and reflecting the myriad influences that shape them. This approach highlights the porous boundaries between design elements, allowing for a fluid exchange of ideas and forms.
            
            The notion of parasitic design extends beyond mere critique; it offers a new way of thinking about the designer's agency. In this framework, the designer is not the sole creator but rather a participant in a broader, more complex ecosystem of interactions. The design process becomes a space of co-creation, where the boundaries between different agents are blurred, and the final output is a product of these ongoing interactions.
            
            This methodologies offer a radical rethinking of traditional design practices. By embracing the fluid, open-ended nature of the design process and rejecting the idea of a privileged center, these methodologies foster a more inclusive, dynamic approach to creativity. The result is a design process that is not only more responsive to external influences but also more reflective of the multiplicity of agents involved in its creation. As design continues to evolve in this direction, it holds the potential to create more adaptive, resilient, and innovative outcomes that truly reflect the diverse world in which we live.

            Sound Installation for Hotel Wittmore
            <br>
        <br>

        <p> Gossiping, whispering, sharing secrets, and making them public: these actions encapsulate what we now refer to as fer safareig—the act of doing laundry in a communal water space. In the current context of ecological drought and privatization, Fer safareig examines water as a connective and communal element, transforming into a symbolic public space that brings forth buried voices and sources.

            Through a neo-archaeological lens focused on the Wittmore Hotel, built on what was once an old public laundry, this project seeks to reimagine its architecture and the echoes of conversations and stories that reverberate within the space it now occupies. These are seen as intrinsically connected to the local community, ecology, and material reality, as well as to the bodies that move through, access, or are excluded from the space.
            
            We cannot assert that the water passing through these bodies—swallowed, digested, spoken—did not also circulate through the laundry on Riudarenes Street. Nor can we deny that the currents of rumors may have flowed from past generations to the present, still filling the streets with stories, critiques, whispers, and demands. Thus, Fer safareig materializes through three scales of interventions centered around water and its privatization. These take the form of a reflective and introspective exercise, programming and public installations, and their activation through engagement with the local community.    </div>
